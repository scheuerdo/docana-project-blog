      " Storytime: this fall I was driving home on I-85 listening to LLM when I check my speedometer & realize I'm going 95mph in a 70 mph zone. I slow down & glance up into my rearview mirror. BAM, I see flashing blue lights! Ohshitohshitohshit, I get into the right lane, slow down & prepare to pull over when I notice that the cop passes me! A few minutes later I see an eighteen-wheeler pulled over off to the side of the interstate.\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: Yeah, I don't think we have the \"genius\" investor here. McCaul's biggest reported income comes from Linda McCaul Descendants Trusts, LLM Partners, LLM Family Investments and a few more variations on that. LLM Partners is named in Clear Channel's annual reports; and it's probably not a stretch to guess that LLM stands for \"Lester Lowry Mays.\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: Well, there's a lot in there, and I don't personally do enema practice myself, so I hesitate to speak \"with authority\", as LLM asked (plus, with good kink lit, actually  reading  it is part of the fun). \n",
      " But hey, good thing you asked, because I just went to look at my books, and I confused titles! Gah! What you actually want is the ultimate guide to anal sex for women (sorry, similar titles, same editor, etc...), and lookie [here]( a PDF! It's the first edition, but still good info, and Taormino's funny and excellently informed. \n",
      " Basically: don't do them too often, clean your equipment properly, do them two or three hours before sex (it can take a while to slosh around), don't really use anything but plain, pure water (maybe a little salt). Really, I hate\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: Here's my advice, take it for what it is. I went to a Tier 4 law school and graduated Magna and was a federal court clerk for 2 years. Afterwards, (and during) I could not find a job to save my life. I decided to apply to Boston University's Tax LLM program (#5 in the nation, it fluctuates between 4 and 5 I think). From there, I graduated #1 in my class and was heavily recruited by tax law firms and accounting firms. \n",
      " The moral of the story, even though the education is literally the exact same, where you go matters. People would constantly say that the reason I did so well at JD was because I was going against people who are not as smart as those who went to Harvard. At Boston University, doing the LLM, I was in classes with people from Boston College, Boston University (top 20 school), Harvard, Columbia, etc..., you get the idea. I ended up #1 in full-time, May graduates. \n",
      " You will always have a range of people at every law school, regardless of what tier it's in. The decision is up to you how hard you want to work. \n",
      " However, here's the important advice, go to the highest ranked school you can get into, no matter where it is. I saw that you'd like to perhaps practice in Boston. It'd be difficult to get a good job in Boston that will provide a decent standard of living (Boston is like right below NYC in terms of costs) without going to a top university. In Boston, you're competing against Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, NYU, Columbia, and some other top school graduates. It's a difficult market. Likewise, NYC is extremely difficult. \n",
      " It's also extremely important to take classes in law school (probably 3L year) and do clinics in a niche area. An associate at my firm was hired directly out of law school (fairly rare nowadays) because he really focused on labor and employment law in law school. The position was for an experienced (1-3 years) attorney, yet he got the job with no \"actual\" experience. \n",
      " Or, you can get an LLM (tax is really the only one worth it) and do it in 3 years with your JD. I had a friend at BU who graduated with a JD and LLM in tax. He had a job right out of school, but his GPA was below 3.5. In that market a GPA that low has a pretty bleak outlook, but because he did the LLM, he was snapped up by a major accounting firm in NYC.\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: Considering the high cost of an American (ivy-league) law degree, you should go up to the LLM in an education system that is cheap (Denmark, or most other EU countries) and then get a JD from an ivy-league school of law if that's your ultimate goal. \n",
      " Most EU law schools offer internationally oriented tracks (I don't mean LLM in international law.) \n",
      " For reference, American JDs are not too strenuous to get for a European LLM. LLDs are a different beast though, similar to European style doctorates of laws. \n",
      " Considering your implied age (around 18?), I would also advise you to get a Master's degree as quickly as possible, and satisfying your wanderlust with some sort of Erasmus exchanges. \n",
      " Then start working for 2 or 3 years. That should get you to around 25, where you'll have a much clearer idea of what you want to do with your life (and also, more importantly, a better idea of who you are.) \n",
      " At this age, then you'll be able to decide correctly what kind of final degree you'll really want. \n",
      " My students are around 22 at the master level, and most of them have absolutely no idea about what to do with their lives. \n",
      " If you can and if you're interested, try on the way to your main masters to pick up a side degree in an unrelated field. For lawyers, you'll get the most profit from an engineering or hard science degree. \n",
      " Also try to pick up a third and fourth language, that helps a lot.\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: In New Zealand we either don't have a constitution or it is an \"unwritten\" one, so I guess he is technically correct. \n",
      " However, that doesn't mean that what he's written isn't absolute garbage.  It stinks of rhetoric, barely makes an argument at all, ignores and fails to discuss key precedents, has a terrible structure to it, and is generally an eye-sore that makes me feel nauseous.  What's more, it's not in line with any NZ style guide and has no citations.  The author is either very sloppy, or he is so arrogant he hasn't yet learned how we do it here. \n",
      " The most important / recent case of jury nullification, or an intentional disregard by the jury of the judge's directions leading to a perverse verdict (as we would call it), was the acquittal of the guys that attacked the American spy bases in Waihopai.  Every lawyer worth their salt knows that ( R v Murnane  (Ruling 8) DC Wellington CRI-2008-006-932, 16 March 2010.)  The fact he missed it out is, again, sloppy or arrogant. \n",
      " Further, in an essay about juries and jury nullification in New Zealand, he fails to mention that from next year jury trials will only be available to offences imprisonable by more than 2 years: (see Criminal Procedure Act 2011 ss 4 and 50).  This is an elementary mistake, and again, it should be in there (even if just in passing). \n",
      " I sincerely hope that this was not used as work towards this guy's recently obtained LLM – even though he talks about fellow Auckland students in it (which makes me think it was).  Had this been handed in where I studied law (Victoria) it would have been stretched to get a C+. \n",
      " Looking through his site, Deliu strikes me as the worst kind of American you can find.  Obese, arrogant, with a little bit of knowledge and a community college law degree.  I'd say he's probably a pretty good talker, but is generally full of shit. \n",
      " Finally, it appears that to be a part of his firm you  \"must have a multi-cultural background\" , who possesses a good understanding of our culture and composition, and who is descended from a signatory of the Treaty of Waitangi, I find that incredibly offensive.  To add to that, it appears from his photo that the only ones that don't fit that bill are the two pretty blonde things.  Go figure?\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: Redditors, there is a lot of misinformation floating around in the comments section. \n",
      " First off, when it comes to federal loans for graduate school, there are no aggregate limits for independent graduate students.  That means there is still a $20,500 limit for UNDERGRADUATE education, however you can draw ANY AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR EDUCATION EXPENSES from the graduate plus loans, with no co-signer, no collateral, and only marginal credit.  Therefore, any assumption that Op is lying because nobody would lend him the money is incorrect, because it's easy to get the money. \n",
      " There are a shocking amount of comments calling OP a liar simply because he won't give out personal information.  Do you really think someone with a million dollars in federal debt who is willing to talk about it wants to be identified?  That could bring a lot of unwanted attention into his life. \n",
      " As for his debt being fake based on the size of the debt, try googling law school tuition.  Average yearly costs for a 4th tier school, which is often where poor people go to law school, is roughly 40k per year in tuition plus 30k per year in living expenses, going to a part time program, means 70k per year for four years, or 280,000, plus accumulating interest at 6.9% yearly, which makes it nearly 320,000$.  Now, include failed semesters, bar debt, fees charged by the banks on student loans, etc.  Rounding up to 400k actually seems very plausible.  Worse yet, what if the student wanted two graduate degrees? \n",
      " Lots of students get more than one graduate degree.  There are two reasons for this, primarily because they cannot get jobs right away and have to keep their bills paid.  Keeping the student loan checks flowing while they search for a job does that.  Also, it lets students without jobs focus their job skills a little more, like an LLM in Tax Law or Bankruptcy Law, or a teaching degree, or something like that. \n",
      " Law degree, 300k, plus an LLM degree so that they can live on student loans for another year while they are unemployed.  That's over 400k in debt and limited career options because law degrees kind of suck.  This post has gotten long but feel free to ask questions.  I can (and almost have) written an entire book on the problems facing students who are trapped in the graduate loan scam.  The ops story is actually quite common. \n",

      "Found 'LLM' in text: First of all, I don't like Romney. I support Obama. \n",
      " Secondly, I am a tax lawyer. I have a Masters in Tax Law (LLM) from New York University. In the mid nineties I was also the Director for Planned Giving at a university and spoke a lot on how charitable giving works. I have been a CPA since 1986. \n",
      " I have commented elsewhere on how CRUTS work, why charities liked them, what their place is within the tax code and why Romney should not be abused for having engaged in this kind of planning. For that, I have been downvoted more than any other comments I have ever made in 3 years as a redditor. \n",
      " The article is just true enough for everyone to break out the pitchforks. There are several things wrong about it. \n",
      " First of all, even prior to 1997, the value of the gift that was made to the charity was discounted by the donor's retained interest (In this case, his 8% unitrust interest). These calculations are made based on actuarial tables and then current interest rate assumptions as published in AFR (Applicable Federal Rate) under Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code. \n",
      " Secondly, there was and has been since a rule that donations of appreciated stock and other property are allowed to pass to the charity at its then fair market value even if there is built in gain. This encourages giving. If that were not the case, people would pay capital gains taxes on money they gave away to the church, animal shelters and the Red Cross. Tax policy dictates that we want to encourage donations, so this rule is a product of that desire. \n",
      " There are less favorable limits on how much you can deduct when you give away appreciated capital gains property vs. case. When you give cash away, you can use deductions up to 1/2 of your Adjusted Gross Income. The limit for appreciated property is 30%. \n",
      " ARE YOUR EYES GLAZING OVER YET? Good. For those that are still awake, there is also a rule that says that to the extent you do not use up all of your charitable deduction in any year as a result of the 1/2 or 30% rule, you can carry forward the deduction for a total of 5 years. \n",
      " I don't get where the article gets the 15 year deferral of, as it implies, all of his taxes. The way a CRUT works, he might have deferred taxes on some of the capital gains on the payments back to him for a period of time, BUT given the 30% limitation and the ability to use it only for 5 years, the MOST he could have avoided in taxes on other income was those associated with 30% of his AGI and then only for a five year period. \n",
      " Oh and that 8%? It is a UNITRUST interest, instead of an ANNUITY. What is the difference? A Unitrust pays 8% of the value of the trust assets from time to time. If the trust does not make 8% it hurts Romney. IF he were privy to knowledge interest rates would drop, he would have formed a CRAT, Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust, which would have paid 8% of the initial value contributed to the trust. IF he was trying to game the rates, he picked wrong. \n",
      " Remember, interest rates were higher when Romney set this up. I would bet that the 8% rate was about equal to the 7520 rate on which his gift was computed. Had interest rates or the portfolio appreciation risen significantly, the charity would have done better, as would have Romney, although by not as much. As interest rates have been low for some time, it makes his gift look smaller now. He had no control over the rates. Also note that the article talks about the charity's share being $421,203 at the end of 2011. What do you bet it is up, as is the rest of the market, in 2012? I bet the charity appreciates the fact they have an interest worth $421,203. \n",
      " If you make a gift to a CRUT and it is value \"at or close to zero\" you don't get a deduction, so the benefits are, obviously,  smaller. No one says that Romney did not receive any deduction for the gifts in the article and it would have been impossible for his gift to have been valueless in 1997 yet be worth $421,203 now. As he gives 10% to his church, I would imagine the gift through the CRUT was beneficial for the church. All you /r atheism guys can hate on that all you want, I can't help what the rules are. I would point out that charities, as a whole, provide benefits to society and giving should be encouraged. But hey, if you want to downvote it is only fake internet points.\n",
      "Found 'LLM' in text: Yeah, I think I would have thought of myself as a failure because of my anti-authoritarian and ADD-driven bad grades, had I not known that I had a very high IQ. I was assessed to be a genius in grade school, but I was also ADD and ended up getting mostly Cs in school.  I didn't turn my grades around until I was a junior in college and decided to go to law school.  It was a struggle (a top LSAT score helped me get into a good law school, despite mediocre grades), but I managed to stay in the top third of my class and to even go on to get a LLM at one of the best law schools in the country.\n",

These positions are highly specialized, and employers seeking students for these positions typically post a job listing rather than participate in on-campus recruiting. \n",
