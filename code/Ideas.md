# Idea Brainstorming

New Idea:
How is the hype around AI refelcted in the data? Title "Did I already say AI?"
)

### Sentiment analysis:
- What sentiments are expressed about AI in Reddit posts and summaries? Are people mostly optimistic, fearful, sarcastic, or neutral?
- Do certain AI topics correlate with specific sentiments? E.g., "AI and privacy" might skew negative, while "AI for productivity" might be positive.
- How does sentiment shift between over the subreddits?

### Topic Modeling
- How does sentiment toward AI differ between full posts and TLDRs? Is the TLDR more emotionally charged or neutral?
- What AI-related topics or subdomains (e.g., ethics, automation, chatbots) are most frequently discussed?
- How does the sentiment of AI-related discussions vary across different subreddits?



#### Others
- Is there a relation between the quality of the summary and the subreddit, the length of the summary and the subreddit, the readablity of the summary and the subreddit? Are they groupable etc.
- Sentiment analysis of the conent and then check if it is also reflected in the summary.
- Topic Modeling: Is the modeled topic of a post related to the subreddit name?
- Is there a relation between the politeness and the subreddit? Is it positive or negative politeness?
( - The content often starts as a own experience and the summary is oftne more general or it is not clear that it is a personal experience, can we do something with this?
