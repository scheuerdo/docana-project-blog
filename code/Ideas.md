# Idea Brainstorming

- Is there a relation between the quality (ROUGE-L) of the summary and the subreddit, the length of the summary and the subreddit, the readablity of the summary and the subreddit? Are they groupable etc.
- Sentiment analysis of the conent and then check if it is also reflected in the summary.
- Topic Modeling: Is the modeled topic of a post related to the subreddit name?
- Is there a relation between the politeness and the subreddit? Is it positive or negative politeness?
- The content often starts as a own experience and the summary is oftne more general or it is not clear that it is a personal experience, can we do something with this?
