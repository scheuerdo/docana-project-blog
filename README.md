- How does sentiment toward AI differ between full posts and TLDRs?


## Introduction

Start off by setting the stage for your project. Give a brief overview of relevant studies or work that have tackled similar issues. Then, clearly describe the main question or problem your project is designed to solve.

## Dataset

Provide a short description of the dataset used in your project. Focus on highlighting the aspects that are particularly relevant to your work.

## Methods

### Setup 


Outline the tools, software, and hardware environment, along with configurations used for conducting your experiments. Be sure to document the Python version and other dependencies clearly. Provide step-by-step instructions on how to recreate your environment, ensuring anyone can replicate your setup with ease:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=<version>
conda activate myenv
```

Include a `requirements.txt` file in your project repository. This file should list all the Python libraries and their versions needed to run the project. Provide instructions on how to install these dependencies using pip, for example:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Experiments

Report how you conducted the experiments. We suggest including detailed explanations of the preprocessing steps and model training in your project. For the preprocessing, describe  data cleaning, normalization, or transformation steps you applied to prepare the dataset, along with the reasons for choosing these methods. In the section on model training, explain the methodologies and algorithms you used, detail the parameter settings and training protocols, and describe any measures taken to ensure the validity of the models.

## Results and Discussion

Present the findings from your experiments, supported by visual or statistical evidence. Discuss how these results address your main research question.

## Conclusion

Summarize the major outcomes of your project, reflect on the research findings, and clearly state the conclusions you've drawn from the study.
